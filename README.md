# Code-Refactor Home Work-01

For this task, I was to refactor an existing webpage to make it more accessible. I utilized the class attribute to simplify many of the multiple classes that were being used. Fixed one of the click options that wasn't working and also gave the page a title. 

I feel this project was tough at first, but once I fully understood what was needed it became much easier. For future developement needs, I would suggest utilizing the class attribute to condense your work. Also using the comment option is great for other people looking into your work.
